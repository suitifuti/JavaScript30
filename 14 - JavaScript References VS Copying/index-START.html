    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // when we assign the var to another one, the value is passed, so age2 will still be 100

    let name = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = 'wesley';
    console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);


    // You might think we can just do something like this:
   // team[3] = 'Lux' // This will update the original array because team is a reference to players
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice() //an empty slice creates a copy of the  array
    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'heeee hawww';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    //captain.number = 99;


    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12}); //start with a blank obj, pass the obj you need to copy from, "fold in" the properties you want to override

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person, number:100};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const gabi = {
      name: 'gabi',
      age: 300,
      social: {
        twitter: '@aaaaa',
        facebook: 'aaaaa'
      }
    }


    const dev = Object.assign({}, gabi);
    dev.name = 'gabriela'
        console.log(gabi)

    console.log(dev);

    dev.social.twitter = '@bbbb' //this will update the original object too, because the clone is 1 level deep

    //the poor man's deep clone: parse to json to clone it
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(gabi));
    //now we can change nested objects without changing the original one
